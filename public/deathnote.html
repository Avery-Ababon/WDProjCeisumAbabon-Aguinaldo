        Deathnote is an anime that originated from the manga at the year 2011. It features the main character Light Yagami, who obtains a deathnote, which can kill people just by writing their name down in the notebook. He has an initial motive of trying to fix the world by removing the people that make it violent. However, once a mysterious detective named L tries to stop him, Light ends up losing his morals, determined to defeat anyone who gets in his way.
        <p>
            Light gets the nickname Kira, or Killer, because of his actions. He ends up manipulating almost everyone into thinking that he isn't the one who's secretly killing everyone. He eventually defeats L, but he doesn't stop killing people. If anything, it escalates to him passing the deathnote to other people, which leads to his demise when L's successor, Near, stops him. This leads to his death, and only then does he realize that what he did was wrong.
