        <h1> BLEACH </h1>
        Bleach is an anime series created by Tite Kubo that originated from manga in August 7, 2001. It features Ichigo Kurosaki as the main character and his friends: Orihime Inoue, Uryu Ishida, Sado "Chad" Yasutora, Rukia Kuchiki, and Renji Abarai.

The anime follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki, a high school student with the ability to see ghosts. The story takes place in Karakura Town where the high schooler, Ichigo Kurosaki, awakens his Soul Reaper powers with the help of Rukia Kuchiki. He uses his new-found power to protect people, souls, and his loved ones. Soon, his immense spiritual energy was too much to affect his friends, Orihime Inoue and Sado “Chad” Yasutora, activating their inner powers and making a team that defeats evil.
