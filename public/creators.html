            Have you ever wondered what would happen if two anime fans meet each other? They form an Otome Visual Novel, combining the universes of the two best animes, Deathnote and Bleach! 
            Hello! We are Avery and Freedom, the creators of this website!

            Hi! My name is Avery, and I'm the #1 Deathnote fan!
            Some of my other favorite anime include NGE, Ergo Proxy, Yuri On Ice, Noragami, Devilman Crybaby, and Cybperpunk Edgerunners!
            My favorite things about Deathnote is the story line and the characters, since it's pretty rare to see characters with an intelligence level that's extremely high. Not only that, most of the characters wear such insanely good outfits that they're enough to make your jaw drop and break!
            To me, the best Deathnote characters are 100% Light, L, Mikami, Mello, and Misa!
            Another thing I like about deathnote is how the characters don't fight through weapons or magic, but they fight through wit and skill instead. I also like how unlike in most anime, the main character of Deathnote dies, and the symbolism portrayed is worth mentioning as it's both interesting and matches the gothic aesthetic of the show.

            <H3>ABOUT FREEDOM:</H3>
            Hello! My name is Freedom, and Bleach is one of my favorite anime! I like 'em because of its exciting storyline and world building.
            I really like the developments of characters especially Ichigo. I like them since their development feels real like it takes time and step by step like most people do. Over time, Ichigo overcomes his survivor's guilt and depression and slowly accepts who he is and it wasn’t his fault that his mom died when he was young. 
            My favorite characters are Orihime Inoue, Kisuke Urahara, and Rukia Kuchiki. I really like Orihime since she's the one I resonate with the most and of course... SAME BIRTHDAY
            For Kisuke, his intelligence impresses me and it makes me feel 3 things: jealous, impressed, and <img src="http://127.0.0.1:5501/assets/freakydeaky.png" width="15px">
            . He's also cool. I like Rukia because she went through so many things and her development after the Soul Society Arc looks natural. She slowly becomes a better version of herself, reflecting and applying what she learned from her mentor and her friend, Ichigo. She will never back down from someone or something to save a person she cares about.
